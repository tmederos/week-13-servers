# week-13-servers

This server was created in week-13 of the UofA bootcamp.

# **Instructions**

* Using the previous example as a guide, create an app that has two web servers.
* One that listens on port 7000 and one that listens on port 7500.
* The one listening on port 7000 will always tell the user something good about themselves.
* The one listening on 7500 will always tell the user something bad about themselves.
* Make sure you create a Github repo and commit this code!
